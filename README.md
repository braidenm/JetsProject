## Jets Project

### Skill Distillery Week 2 HomeWork

This project simulates and airfield: 
A user is presented with a menu: 
* view all fleet of jets with jet and pilot information
* Fly all Jets that show the jet information and how long it can fly, also shows the speed converted to MACH
* View the fastest jet out of the fleet
* View the jet that can go the furthest distance
* Load cargo into all the Jets that can carry cargo
* Have the jets that can fight fire their weapons and more (will explain more later)
* Add a new Jet to the fleet
* Pick only one jet to "fly"
* Add and change a pilot to a jet on the fleet

#### In the fight menu:

* Have all fighting jets fire all of their weapons, once a jet fires its weapons it will need to reload before it can fire again
* Reload all jet's weapons
* Pick one jet to blow up another jet (the jet that was blown up is not taken out of inventory)
* Fire all machine guns for only jets with machine guns (will need to reload)
* fire all missiles for all jets that have missiles (will need to reload)
* drop all bombs from all jets that have bombs (will need to reload)
* Have all Jets do a barrel roll
* Have all Jets Kamakazie

#### Stretch goals:
Given more time I would have liked to add more features such as: 
* Selecting one fighting jet to perform all the functions of fight menu.
* Removing Jets that were Blown up
* added more guns and types of jets
* added more evasive manuevers
* added a dogfight function that would pick one jet and fight another with hitpoints and health. Like a game.

#### Topic and Technologies
* Object-Oriented programming
* Arrays
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* abstraction
* Encapsulation
* converting unicode emoji's
* loops (foreach, for, while, do-while)
* some Junit testing
* StringBuilder
* Switch Statements
* casting objects
* methods
* ternary's


#### Challenges

* At the moment could not get a proper randomizer for adding a pilot to a random Jet. Since the array had 20 spots and only 9 jets it would put a pilot in an  empty slot giving me a null exception error, or since I was using Math.random it would pick a slot that it picked before. I will find the answer for this!

* I would write something, such as adding a pilot to a jet, then realize a more efficeint method to do so and have to re-write some code. I ended up doing this a few times with various objects. With more experience I am striving to write it effeciently the first time.

* debugging takes a lot of time!

* Need to study more on how to use Junit testing. writing simple tests were fine, but testing methods from various objects I could not do at the moment.
